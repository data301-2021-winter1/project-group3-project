## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Kevin: I am excited to work with this dataset because there are many attributes that contribute to an individual's yearly earnings and I believe that this dataset may be able to point to the ones that are most important.  As a student working towards finishing my degree, I am more specifically interested in the education attribute and how it affects income compared to a less-educated adult.  I am also interested in the comparison between countries, and how developed countries compare to less-developed countries.  Research questions relating to these attributes are of interest to me. After the completion of this project, I hope to have a better understanding of these attributes and how they affect an individual earning greater than or less than $50,000.

Riley: I am interested in the data for the same reasons as stated prior. I am also intedested in the distribution of pay between people who share the same attributes.

Anna: I am interested in this dataset for various reasons, but I am going to use this dataset to determine if there is a correlation betwen family makeup and earning, such as marital status and family relationship. Also would be interested to note the variations in family makeup patterns within different countires, and if the same patterns lead to the same overall result. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The information within the dataset was extracted from the 1994 census by Barry Becker. It examines the incomes of the population, as well as various facts and factors about each person. Some of these factors include age, education, marital status, gender age, and country of origin. The purpose of the dataset is for public interest, or learning, as it is simply collected census information. Each individual within thsi dataset gives information about all of the aforementioned qualities, and whether they make over or under $50 000. Using this data, one could find the correlation between any number of variables about the person's life, and see if there is any relation between certain life aspects and the amount of money they tend to make.
