## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Kevin: I am excited to work with this dataset because there are many attributes that contribute to an individual's yearly earnings and I believe that this dataset may be able to point to the ones that are most important.  As a student working towards finishing my degree, I am more specifically interested in the education attribute and how it affects income compared to a less-educated adult.  I am also interested in the comparison between countries, and how developed countries compare to less-developed countries.  Research questions relating to these attributes are of interest to me. After the completion of this project, I hope to have a better understanding of these attributes and how they affect an individual earning greater than or less than $50,000.
